Full stack Ruby developer with a strong analytical background. 

## Skills

My craving for knowledge always ended with me starting totally new projects in my prior profession as a finance analyst.
One day I found myself building from scratch financial model using basic SQL language (Excel Macro). Before I even didn't think that I can be a developer. But my model worked and I enjoyed the process. That is how I realize that I admire more problem-solving and code crunching tasks than money counting :)

This idea brought me to one of the most cool and discerning dev boot camps in the world - Makers Academy!

### Let's see what I have:

  **Excellent background to be a confident junior developer:**

   to be attempt

  **Strong analytical skills:**

  My University gave me a strong math background and my experience as an analyst and auditor polish my knowledge.

  During my work as an analyst, I had a chance to take part in many international projects in different business areas.
  I learned to work with a big data in tight deadlines, by trying to see what is truly important,
  allocating time properly be efficient without letting quality suffer.
  Because work we did was our product and the quality of the product - is a face and image of the company.

  **Stress resistance**

  My experience gave me a chance to test myself in challenging situations.
  I had a chance to conduct top-management interviews in highly stressed situations and
  negotiate with a client on different management levels.
  The best way to overcome stress is to think positive and remember that only by challenging ourselves we can become better.

  **High communication skills**

  I can be a good team player as well as working independently and be totally responsible for the thing I have done.
  Working and studying with different people all over the world,
  I learned how to build good relationships with my team and with a client,
  which are a crucial factor in the healthy working environment.
  I learned to appreciate other people values, understand different cultures and work hard to build effective working conditions.


### What's more:
  * I learn fast and open for everything new.
  * I knew a few languages:
    * English and Russian languages â€” fluent
    * German language - intermediate
